I have had none of the extra pyramidal or cognitive side effects, but it did make me a little bit hypomanic at first and has made my sleep very fragmented, so I have had to take Saphris some nights to bring me down and help me sleep.

Initially, Vraylar worked very well. Then it wore off and my dose was increased. This repeated until I was at the max dose of 6 mg and it stopped working again so I discontinued it. I was told to go off of it cold turkey due Vraylar’s long half life. That’s when I started experiencing withdrawal emergent tardive dyskinesia (TD), which per my docs reports should go away but it has not (she reports that 90% of patients experience remission of this). For me, this presents as uncontrollable mouth (lip) and tongue movements. I even went back on Vraylar to do a 2.5 month taper to help reduce my TD symptoms.

But that is not even the problem.

STOPPING THIS DRUG IS DANGEROUS. My doctor didn't wean me off the drug, and she was wrong for that.
